    <h2>About</h2>

    <p>
      I’m a third-year Financial Engineering student at Columbia University interested in how
      complex systems are built, scaled, and experienced by real users.
    </p>

    <p>
      Academically, my background sits at the intersection of mathematics, computer
      science, and decision-making. Through coursework and hands-on projects, I’ve
      worked on backend systems, data pipelines, and infrastructure that prioritize
      reliability, performance, and clarity.
    </p>

    <p>
      Alongside technical work, I’m drawn to product thinking—understanding user needs,
      defining success metrics, and translating abstract problems into structured,
      actionable solutions. This perspective shapes how I approach both engineering and
      leadership roles.
    </p>

    <p>
      Outside of engineering, I explore visual storytelling through photography, digital
      design, and content strategy. These creative pursuits influence how I think about
      communication, narrative, and user experience across everything I build.
