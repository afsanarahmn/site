           <h3>Exiger – Product Operations Intern</h3>
           <p>
             • Debugged 50+ client-reported issues weekly by tracing failures across backend services, REST APIs, authentication layers, and
data pipelines supporting DDIQ and Insight Admin in production environments, reducing average resolution time by 18%. <br>
• Analyzed production logs, metrics, and Kibana dashboards to identify recurring failure patterns across distributed services,
partnering with DevOps to prioritize backend and infrastructure fixes that drove a 25–30% reduction in ticket volume.
<br> • Built a Client Friction Heatmap using Python to aggregate and normalize Salesforce and Zendesk data across workflows, surfacing
systemic bottlenecks that informed backend improvements and reduced customer onboarding time by 14%.</p>

           <h3>Amazon – Software Development Engineer Intern</h3>
           <p>
            • Engineered and deployed a resilient health-monitoring system for ETCD databases across 14+ EKS clusters using Lambda and
CloudWatch, reducing average incident response time by 40% through automated real-time alerting and monitored dashboards.
<br> 
• Calibrated CloudWatch alarm thresholds and event-driven workflows with AWS SNS, Lambda, and Step Functions, cutting
recurring false positives by 30% while enabling significantly earlier detection of ETCD health anomalies in Kubernetes clusters.
<br> 
• Redesigned Lambda-based infrastructure and integrated Silvermine APIs to improve ETCD version compatibility, decrease
deployment failures, and boost overall system performance by 25% through fully automated CI/CD release pipelines.</p>

           <h3>Bloomberg – Software Engineer Intern</h3>
           <p>
            • Built a real-time data windowing system using Apache Flink to segment high-frequency Instant Bloomberg messages, enabling
two times faster compliance validation across distributed financial data pipelines for institutional trading clients worldwide. <br>
• Engineered a custom Apache Flink aggregation operator to reconstruct structured transcripts from raw event streams, supporting
over 500 concurrent users while enhancing auditability and boosting end-to-end data processing throughput by 18%. <br>
• Accelerated stream performance by refactoring memory management and tuning event-time watermarking, reducing late data
accumulation by 22% and increasing pipeline reliability across high-volume, latency-sensitive production environments.
           </p>

           <h3>NASA – Product Strategy Fellow </h3>
           <p>
            • Defined product scope and success metrics for COCOA Swarm, an AI-enabled Mars microbot platform, evaluating autonomy,
mobility, and sensor payload tradeoffs to prioritize features aligned with life-detection feasibility and mission constraints.
<br> • Owned roadmap and milestone planning for proposal delivery, working with subsystem leads and NASA SMEs to translate
technical constraints into a phased development plan and competitive proposal submission.
